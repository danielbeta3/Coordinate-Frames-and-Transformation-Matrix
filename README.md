# Coordinate-Frames-and-Transformation-Matrix
This repository provides Python utilities for preliminary aircraft analysis, including aerodynamic angle calculations (α, β, γ), coordinate transformations in BODY/WORLD frames, construction of reference vectors for velocity and axis visualization, and interactive 3D aircraft visualization using `.stl` models with aerodynamic vectors.
